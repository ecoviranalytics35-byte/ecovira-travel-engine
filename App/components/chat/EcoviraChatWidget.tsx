  'where search': "You can search directly on this page. For flights: enter departure and destination airports (e.g., MEL, SYD), select dates, choose passengers and cabin class, then tap 'Search Flights'. For stays: enter city, check-in date, nights, and guests. For cars: enter pickup/return location and dates. For transfers: enter from/to locations and date/time. Once results appear, I'll help you compare options, prices, and currency strategies.",
  'how search': "To search: 1) Enter your travel details in the search panel (from/to, dates, passengers), 2) Select your preferred currency (top-right), 3) Tap the search button. Results appear below. The AI Assist widget (bottom-right) provides Value Scores and recommendations. I can help you understand the results and find the best option.",
  'one way round trip': "One-way means a single flight from A to B. Round-trip includes both outbound and return flights. Round-trip is often cheaper per flight, but one-way offers flexibility. Use the toggle at the top of the search panel to switch. For round-trip, you'll need to select both departure and return dates.",
  'search flights': "To search flights: Enter departure airport (e.g., MEL), destination airport (e.g., SYD), departure date, passengers, cabin class (economy/business/first), and optionally return date for round-trip. Select your currency, then tap 'Search Flights'. Results show price, duration, stops, and airline. The AI Assist widget provides Value Scores and recommendations.",
  'search stays': "To search stays: Enter city name, check-in date, number of nights, adults, children (optional), and room type. Select your currency, then tap 'Search Stays'. Results show hotel name, location, price per night, and total cost. The AI Assist widget shows total trip cost estimates.",
  'search cars': "To search cars: Enter pickup location, pickup date and time, return date and time, and driver age. Select your currency, then tap 'Search Cars'. Results show vehicle type, vendor, price per day, and total rental cost.",
  'search transfers': "To search transfers: Enter pickup location, drop-off location, date, time, and number of passengers. Select your currency, then tap 'Search Transfers'. Results show transfer type, price, and duration.",
  'filters': "Filters help narrow results. For flights: you can filter by stops (direct, 1-stop, 2+ stops), price range, departure time, airline, and duration. For stays: filter by star rating, price range, amenities, and cancellation policy. Use the search panel to adjust dates, passengers, and cabin class before searching.",
  'dates work': "Dates control when you travel. For flights: select departure date (required) and return date (for round-trip). For stays: select check-in date and number of nights. For cars: select pickup and return dates/times. Prices vary significantly by date—weekends and peak seasons cost more. Consider flexible dates to find better prices.",
  'passengers': "Passengers determine how many people are traveling. For flights: adults (required), children (2-11), infants (under 2). For stays: adults and children determine room capacity. For cars: driver age affects rental eligibility and fees. For transfers: number of passengers affects vehicle size and price. Prices are usually per person for flights, per night for stays, per day for cars.",
  'cabin class': "Cabin class determines comfort level. Economy: standard seating, basic amenities. Business: more space, better meals, priority boarding. First: premium experience, most expensive. Prices increase with class. Economy is most common and cost-effective. Business and First offer more comfort but cost significantly more.",
  
  // Search & Results (Flights)
  'best option': "I compare price, duration, stops, and overall value — not just the cheapest fare.\n\nTell me your route and dates, and I'll guide you.",
  'best value': "I compare price, duration, stops, and overall value — not just the cheapest fare.\n\nTell me your route and dates, and I'll guide you.",
  'cheaper': "Flight prices vary based on airline, route popularity, booking time, and fare class. However, when prices differ across currencies, it's often due to regional pricing models and currency conversion layers (bank FX margins, payment processing fees). This is legal price arbitrage—the base price may be similar, but the cost of converting and processing the payment changes. Ecovira shows multiple currencies so you can see these differences transparently.",
  'stops': "Stops occur when a flight doesn't have a direct route or when connecting is cheaper. Direct flights (0 stops) are fastest but may cost more. 1-stop flights offer a balance. 2+ stops are usually cheapest but take longer.",
  'stopover worth': "A stopover can be worth it if you save significantly on price and don't mind the extra travel time. For short trips, direct flights are usually better. For longer trips, a stopover can break up the journey. Check the AI Value Score for recommendations.",
  'fastest': "The fastest option is usually the direct flight (0 stops) with the shortest total duration. Check the AI Assist widget for 'Fastest' recommendation based on your search results.",
  'cheapest': "The cheapest option may have stops or less convenient times. Check the AI Assist widget for 'Cheapest' recommendation. Remember: cheapest isn't always best value—consider duration and convenience too.",
  'prices change': "Prices can change due to demand, availability, and airline pricing. Once you click 'Select Flight' and proceed to booking, we'll hold the price for a short period. Final pricing is confirmed at payment.",
  
  // Pricing & Fees
  'fees': "Ecovira shows total prices upfront before you pay. Any airline fees or payment charges are included at checkout — no surprises.\n\nAre you checking fees for a specific booking?",
  'fee': "Ecovira shows total prices upfront before you pay. Any airline fees or payment charges are included at checkout — no surprises.\n\nAre you checking fees for a specific booking?",
  'service fee': "Ecovira shows total prices upfront before you pay. Any airline fees or payment charges are included at checkout — no surprises.\n\nAre you checking fees for a specific booking?",
  'included in price': "The displayed price includes the base fare, taxes, and our 4% service fee. For flights, it's typically per person. For stays, it's usually per night. For cars, it's usually per day. Check the AI Assist widget for detailed breakdowns.",
  'why service fee': "The service fee supports our platform operations, including secure payment processing, customer support, booking management, and continuous platform improvements. It's a standard industry practice for online travel platforms.",
  'fee calculated': "The service fee is 4% of the base fare (before taxes). For example: if a flight costs 100 AUD total, the base is ~96.15 AUD and the fee is ~3.85 AUD. All prices shown include this fee.",
  'fee refundable': "The service fee is generally non-refundable, but if the airline cancels or you're eligible for a full refund, we'll process it accordingly. Refund policies depend on the fare type and airline rules.",
  'per person or total': "For flights, prices are typically per person. For stays, prices are usually per night. For cars, prices are usually per day. The AI Assist widget shows total trip costs clearly.",
  'price different': "Prices may differ from airline/hotel sites due to: our aggregated search across multiple providers, real-time availability, currency conversion, and our service fee. Additionally, prices can differ across currencies due to regional pricing models and currency conversion layers (bank FX margins, payment processing fees). This is legal price arbitrage—not a loophole—where regional pricing and payment rails affect the final cost. Ecovira shows multiple currencies transparently so you can see these differences. We aim to show competitive, transparent pricing.",
  'price change currency': "When you switch currencies, prices are converted using current exchange rates. However, the actual cost can differ due to regional pricing models and currency conversion layers. Airlines and hotels often price differently by region, and when you view or pay in another currency, you may avoid certain bank FX margins or regional markups. This is legal price arbitrage—not a loophole—where the base price is similar, but the cost of converting and processing the payment changes. Ecovira shows multiple currencies transparently so you can see these differences.",
  
  // Currency & Payments
  'currency crypto': "Prices can change depending on currency and payment method. In some cases, paying in a different currency or with crypto can reduce costs.\n\nAre you comparing options or ready to book?",
  'currency': "Prices can change depending on currency and payment method. In some cases, paying in a different currency or with crypto can reduce costs.\n\nAre you comparing options or ready to book?",
  'crypto': "Prices can change depending on currency and payment method. In some cases, paying in a different currency or with crypto can reduce costs.\n\nAre you comparing options or ready to book?",
  'pay in another currency': "Yes! We support multiple currencies: AUD, USD, EUR, GBP, TRY, AED, SAR, QAR, KWD, INR, THB, MYR, SGD, JPY, KRW. Select your preferred currency in the search panel.",
  'support crypto': "Yes! We accept cryptocurrencies: USDT, USDC, BTC, and ETH. Select your preferred cryptocurrency in the currency selector. All crypto payments are processed securely.",
  'crypto cheaper': "Crypto doesn't change airline prices directly, but it can reduce bank conversion layers. In some international bookings, paying with crypto or stablecoins avoids card FX margins. However, network fees and volatility still apply, so it's not always cheaper. This is part of currency arbitrage—the base price is the same, but the payment processing cost changes. Ecovira's approach is to explain both the benefits and the limits so you can decide safely. Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) reduce volatility risk compared to BTC/ETH, but network fees still apply.",
  'exchange rate': "We use real-time exchange rates from reputable financial data providers. Rates update frequently to reflect current market conditions. The rate is locked when you proceed to payment. Exchange rates fluctuate, so prices in different currencies will vary—the actual value remains the same, but the displayed amount changes based on current rates.",
  
  // Tickets & Booking
  'after select flight': "After clicking 'Select Flight': 1) You'll see a booking summary with flight details and total price, 2) Enter passenger details (name, email, phone, optional SMS opt-in), 3) Choose payment method (card or crypto), 4) Complete secure payment, 5) Receive confirmation email with booking reference.

  'booking takes time': "Bookings are processed automatically after payment. Most confirm within seconds, but some may take a few minutes if the airline's system is busy. You'll receive email updates when the booking is confirmed. If there's an issue, we'll notify you immediately and process a refund if needed.",
  'price changes booking': "If the price changes during booking, we'll show you the updated price before payment. You can choose to proceed or cancel. Once payment is successful, the price is locked. If the airline's price increases significantly after payment but before confirmation, we'll notify you and offer options (pay difference, cancel with refund, or find alternative).",
  'booking fails': "If a booking fails after payment, we'll automatically process a full refund to your original payment method. You'll receive email confirmation of the refund. This is rare, but can happen if the airline's system rejects the booking or inventory changes. Contact support if you have concerns.",
  'hold fare': "We don't currently offer fare holds. Prices can change, so we recommend booking when you're ready. However, during the booking process, we'll hold the price for a short period while you complete payment. Once payment is successful, the price is locked.",
